#What’s this?

[Mystic Pillars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HolyCow.MysticPillars) is an Indian (Kannada) smartphone game.

Pillars are connected with links; some are unidirectional, some are bidirectional. Some pillars have gems on them. The move is: if the shortest path between pillars A and B is 4, then you take 4 gems from pillar A and put them to pillar B. You must convert the pillars to predetermined final state in N moves.

I stuck in level 95 and decided to write a solver.

Right now you program levels just in source code.
